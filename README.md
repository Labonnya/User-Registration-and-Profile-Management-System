The registration form is a web-based form that allows users to provide their information for creating an account or registering for a service. The form consists of various input fields where users can enter their personal details such as name, email, address, and additional relevant information. Along with the input fields, the form includes two buttons: "Submit" and "Reset."

1. Submit Button: When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the form data is validated to ensure that all required fields are filled correctly. If the validation is successful, the form data is processed and stored, and the user is redirected to a profile page or a confirmation page, indicating that their registration was successful.

2. Reset Button: The "Reset" button allows users to clear all the entered information in the form, allowing them to start again from a blank form.

This registration form provides a user-friendly interface for capturing user data and facilitates the registration process. It ensures that user inputs are securely collected and processed, contributing to a seamless and reliable registration experience.
